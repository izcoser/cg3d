This was the final project for my Computer Graphics class. It is a 3D fighting game made with the OpenGL API. It has 3 camera modes, first person, third person, and fist cameras, as well as a split screen mode which shows the opponent's view.

The goal was for students to put to practice all the theory seen in class, and learn by doing. Below are some screenshots:

To run this, you need GLUT installed and also [download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ydvwkjnmlfd11gk/models.zip?dl=0) the models and extract them to the game's folder.
The code uses some deprecated functions from OpenGL 1.0, which should be replaced with a more modern approach as soon as I have time to!
